# Big_data_compression_iot
course_project for advanced operating systems big data compression in iot 
Platform:
Matlab
Hardware used:
Processor: i5 core
RAM: 8GB
Operating System: Windows
System Configuration: 64 bit

Modules:
1. Video formation module "videocreation.m" to create a video from data-set
2. See External software section below to encode a video formed in module 1 and decode it for module 3
3. Video reconstruction module "Videoreconstruction.m" to a create the data-set from the H264decoded video
4. Benchmark module "benchmark.m" to check the accuracy rate of the proposed method with the benchmark model Sensor compression

External softwares used:
1. Download software from http://www.h264encoder.com/ and upload the video formed from module 1 and encode in normal quality.
2. Upload the encoded video obtained from 1 and feed it to https://www.filezigzag.com/ and give conversion type as .AVi and get the video from this to feed to module 3 specified above
